# 61 Python program to get an absolute file path
"""
According to docs os.path.abspath() returns a normalized 
absolutized version of the pathname path which may sound 
fancy but it simply means that this method returns the pathname
 to the path passed as a parameter to this function.

import os
print(os.path.abspath('path_fname'))
