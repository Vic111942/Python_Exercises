#  Write a Python program to determine if a Python shell is executing in 32bit or 64bit mode on OS
# struct module
# This module performs conversions between Python values and C structs represented as Python bytes objects
# struct.calcsize(format)
# Return the size of the struct (and hence of the bytes object produced by pack(format, ...)) 
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html
#           corresponding to the format string format.
# For 32 bit it will return 32 and for 64 bit it will return 64
import struct
print(struct.calcsize("P") * 8)
print(struct.calcsize("s") * 8)
